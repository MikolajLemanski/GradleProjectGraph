# Quickstart

1. Open the repository input page (index.html).
2. (Optional) Paste a GitHub Personal Access Token into the "GitHub Personal Access Token" field.
3. Click "Set Token" — the client will validate the token and display an authenticated username if valid.
4. Enter a GitHub repository URL and click "Analyze Repository".
5. To remove the token during the session, click "Remove Token"; subsequent requests will be unauthenticated.

Notes:
- Tokens are stored only for the current browser session and are never persisted to disk or server.
- For private repository access, create a PAT with the `repo` scope.
